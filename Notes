React JS

Large scale frontend app

VSCode use Emmet

Html:5 

Hello world using HTML , JS and , using CDN React

What is CDN?

What is cross origin ?

Open the CDN link and see its at the end of the day is JS

Go to console and write React

Two diff CDN links since react Dom can be plugged only for browser
Main file is react.development.js

There is react native which works on mobile

Which ever we need we can plug apart from react development js

Type ReactDOM as well in console

Write code for hello world React

Put all your code in App.js file

In browser the most expensive operation is DOM manipulation

Why root element in react?

React and other framework are ultimately optimising DOM manipulation

Use attributes in createElement 

Add a css file and make the h1 as red

<link rel=“stylesheet” href=“./index.css”>

Print using console.log(reactElement) you will see it is a react element

When we call render then only react will inject the element in the DOM


Parent , child , h1 tag using react

console.log(parent)

ReactElement (Object) => HTML (browser understands)

Multiple siblings add more children

Make two divs under child

JSX exists

Order of the files matter in JS as it is an interpreted language
 
Why script tag is present in body and not head


Difference between production and dev CDN links?

Static content is being replaced  not appended

Refresh your page fast
 
Define header and footer and see as static if react will replace it or not

React is a library not a framework it can work only at a portion of a webpage
